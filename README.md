# My Learning Repository of *Computer System: A Programmer's Perspective*

## About the book

I am currently learning *Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective (third edition)* by Randal E. Bryant and David R. O’Hallaron, which is the reference book of the sophomore course "Introduction to Computer Systems".

## My Goals

I desire to record my progress in learning computer systems. Therefore, I will upload all my solution to the problems mentioned in the book and will comment thoroughly to ensure that I can understand the code whenever I look back on them.
