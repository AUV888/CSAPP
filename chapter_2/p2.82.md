# A. `(x<y) == (-x>-y)`

This is false when `x = INT_MIN` and y is an arbitrary number that is greater than x.

# B. `((x+y)<<4) + y-x == 17*y+15*x`

This is false when `15*x` is less than `INT_MAX` but `16*x` is greater than `INT_MAX`, which will certainly cause overflow.

# C. `~x+~y+1 == ~(x+y)`

This is true, since `x+~x=-1` , so we now that `~x=-x-1`. Thus, the left part is equivalent to `-x-1-y-1+1 = -x-y-1`, where the right part is also equivalent to `-x-y-1`.

# D. `(ux-uy) == -(unsigned)(y-x)`

Left part is equivalent to `(ux-uy) mod 2^w` ,  where the right part is equivalent to `(x-y) mod 2^w`. As ux and x, uy and y have the same bit representation, the left part is equivalent to the right part.

# E. `((x >> 2) << 2) <= x`

This is true, since the right shift operation is round to floor, therefore, for every number x, $x\text{>>}2 \le x\div 4$, so when x>>2 is timed by 4, it is also less or equal than x.
